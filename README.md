<p>Developed by Novelintel Investigations</p><br>

# What is Novelintel?  
<p>Novelintel is a comprehensive toolkit designed for expanding, gathering and harvesting Information aswell as network analysis. It supports assessments across both local and remote environments and integrates a wide range of utilities to assist security professionals in evaluating system resilience. One notable component is its web module, inspired by Hound (developed by TechChipNet). While Hound focuses primarily on geolocation capture, Novelintel expands the concept by offering a modular interface capable of simulating additional data‑collection vectors such as device sensors and credential‑capture workflows for legitimate testing scenarios. The interface has been extensively redesigned, retaining only the core payload structure and conversational layout.</p><br><br>

<p>Beyond its web‑based features, Novelintel provides streamlined installation and usage of essential security tools including Nmap, Hydra, John the Ripper, and many others. The toolkit operates through a command‑line interface and is optimized for Debian‑based distributions to ensure reliability and minimize configuration issues. Included tools are installed via Snap or APT to ensure proper PATH integration and consistent behavior. Novelintel also offers optional installation of reputable open‑source security projects such as Airgeddon and Fluxion, which significantly enhance wireless assessment capabilities. The toolkit brings together a diverse collection of utilities ranging from widely used industry standards to lesser‑known niche tools acknowledging that different practitioners rely on different methodologies and workflows.</p><br>
